The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there's a potential issue if you have spaces around the operators inside `calc()`. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` is correct. But `width: calc( 100% - 20px );` might not work in some browsers, or might be interpreted differently than intended.  Another error could be due to improper use of units or mixing incompatible units within the calculation.
